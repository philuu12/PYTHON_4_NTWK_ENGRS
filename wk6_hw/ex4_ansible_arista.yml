#4. Use Ansible to restore your 'primary Ethernet interface' back to the following state (or your secondary interface depending on which one you used):
#
#description:                    <none>
#switchport mode:           access
#access VLAN:                1
#trunk allowed VLANs:    all
#
#Also use Ansible to remove the three VLANs that you configured.
