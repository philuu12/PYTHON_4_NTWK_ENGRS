#2. Use Ansible to configure your 'primary Ethernet interface' as follows:
#
#interface description:     *** IN USE ***
#switchport mode:          access
#VLAN:                           <one of the VLANs created in exercise1>
#
#Your 'primary Ethernet interface' is specified in your ~/ansible-hosts file.
#
#If your primary interface is already 'IN USE' (by someone else), then use 
#your secondary interface (once again specified in ~/ansible-hosts).  You can 
#determine if an interface is already in use by SSH'ing into the switch. 
#Reminder, do NOT use Ethernet1.
