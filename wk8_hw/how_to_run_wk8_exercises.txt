How to run all exercises in Week 8:

1) Generate information from the models, so that Python will know how to generate tables next:
python /home/pluu/DJANGOX/djproject/manage.py  makemigrations net_system

2) Initialize the setup of the Database:
python /home/pluu/DJANGOX/djproject/manage.py migrate

3) Load device info and credentials into the Database:
python /home/pluu/DJANGOX/djproject/net_system/load_devices.py
python /home/pluu/DJANGOX/djproject/net_system/load_credentials.py

4) (Optional) Then one can run commands to modify the network device objects:
(applied_python)[pluu@ip-172-30-0-57 djproject]$ pwd
/home/pluu/DJANGOX/djproject
(applied_python)[pluu@ip-172-30-0-57 djproject]$ python manage.py shell
>>>
>>>from net_system.models import NetworkDevice, Credentials
>>>devices = NetworkDevice.objects.all()     # Query database of all object devices.
>>>creds = Credentials.objects.all()
>>> devices     # 7 of them. type:  type(devices)
>>> creds         # 2 of them. type: type(creds)
>>> for a_device in devices:
>>> print a_device.device_name
>>> cisco1 = devices(0)
>>> cisco1.device_name
>>> cisco1.ip_address

Note: Running all the scripts sequentially 1 to 8 also helps, but not necessarily. Exercise 1 loads
the devices and their credentials needed for later exercises. Without running exercise 1 first,
subsequent scripts might not run. (This issue is now no longer present; exercise 1 is imported in
subsequent exercises. Thus, all remaing exercises don't depend on Exercise 1 running already anymore.)
