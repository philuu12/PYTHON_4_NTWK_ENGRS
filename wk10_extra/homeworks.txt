1. Use Juniper's PyEZ library to make a connection to the Juniper SRX and to print out the device's facts.

2. For each of the SRX's interfaces, display: the operational state, 
packets-in, and packets-out. You will probably want to use EthPortTable for 
this.

3. Display the SRX's routing table. You will probably want to use RouteTable for this (from jnpr.junos.op.routes import RouteTable).

The output should look similiar to the following:

Juniper SRX Routing Table: 
0.0.0.0/0
  nexthop 10.220.88.1
  age 14582542
  via vlan.0
  protocol Static

10.220.88.0/24
  nexthop None
  age 14583120
  via vlan.0
  protocol Direct

10.220.88.39/32
  nexthop None
  age 14583289
  via vlan.0
  protocol Local

4. Use the PyEZ load() method to set the hostname of the SRX using set, conf (curly brace), and XML formats.

After each load(), display the differences between the running config and the candidate config. Additionally, perform at least one commit and one rollback(0) in this program.

The committed hostname at the end of the program should be:  pynet-jnpr-srx1
