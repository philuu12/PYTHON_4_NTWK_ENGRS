My solutions to these exercises are posted at:

Increasing the connection timeout: 

>>> from jnpr.junos import Device
>>> a_device = Device(host="101.101.101.228", user='pyclass', password='password')
>>> a_device.open()
Device(101.101.101.228)
>>> a_device.timeout
30
>>> a_device.timeout = 120 

The timeout defaults to 30 seconds. Here, I set it to 120 seconds.
